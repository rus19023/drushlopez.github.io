Your Name:

*** Doris Rush-Lopez

1. What is one advantage of MergeSort compared to QuickSort, and one advantage of QuickSort?

*** MergeSort is more efficient and faster for larger lists, but it takes up more memory with the temporary lists it makes. QuickSort is more efficient for smaller lists and takes up less space because it needs no temporary list, it sorts "in-place". 


2. What sorting algorithm is the default, built-in algorithm used by Python? (Use the Internet to track this down.) Briefly describe how it works.

*** The algorithm is called Timsort and uses a blend of merge and insertion sort algorithms, finding and merging already sorted pieces of the list. 


3. What is the most interesting thing you learned as a part of your work for this class this week?

*** I didn't do the prove part until several days after the checkpoints, and was surprised to see that I had used part of the merge sort to fulfill one of the tasks, #8 I think, without realizing it until I went back to the reading to review so I could answer the first question in this ponder text.


4. Describe one specific way that you helped someone else this week, or reached out for help.

*** I asked my partner in the team challenge for help, and she was able to give me some tips. I also shared with her some things I saw to help her see another way to do a task.


5. Are there any topics from this week that you still feel uneasy about, or would like to learn more about?

*** I need more practice in using the sorting algorithms. I understand there is the built-in function, but I need to solve more problems without it to better understand them.


6. How much time did you spend this week on each of the following:

Reading - 2 hours
Checkpoint A - 1 hour
Checkpoint B - 1.5 hours
Team Activity - 1.5 hours
Data Structures Homework - 1 hour
Prove Assignment - 8 hours
