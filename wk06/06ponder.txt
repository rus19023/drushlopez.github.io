Your Name:

1. Give a specific example of a time when you might want to override a method from a base class.

** When the child needs different data or processing of data, as in the super target in the skeet game. It needed special processing for the different scoring and number of hits to kill it, which was easily accomplished in the hit() function overriding that from the basic flying object class' hit() function.


2. Do you think IS-A or HAS-A is a better choice for the team activity (Circles and Points)? Why?

** I like the is-a method better, it seems to cause less coding, or at least it was easier for me to figure out.



3. What is the most interesting thing you learned as a part of your work for this class this week?

** Learning a little about the trig functions for the skeet angle calculations was rather interesting. I haven't thought about physics and such very much in about 4 decades...


4. Describe one specific way that you helped someone else this week, or reached out for help.

** I asked for help at least a couple of times and also posted some helpful links for everyone in slack.


5. Are there any topics from this week that you still feel uneasy about, or would like to learn more about?  

** Not much, I think I just need more practice. I still haven't figured out completely the 2nd part of the stretch in the team activity. If I ever find time I will go back to it.   I also wish I could figure out a better way of managing my time so I can get caught up...


6. How much time did you spend this week on each of the following:

Reading - 2.5 hours
Checkpoint A - 2 hours
Checkpoint B - 2 hours
Team Activity - 2.5 hours
Data Structures Homework - 3 hours
Prove Assignment - 5.5 hours

If you have other questions or comments for the instructor, please post them to Slack, either in the general channel if others can benefit, or as a direct message if the matter is more personal.
