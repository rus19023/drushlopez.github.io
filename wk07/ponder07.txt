1. Take a minute to search the Internet for an explanation of "polymorphism". You might especially consider sources such as StackOverflow and Wikipedia. After reading through some of these, in your own words, describe polymorphism AND why it's useful.

*** Polymorphism is the way methods and attributes can be shared from a "mother" class, yet be totally different. The way animals are classified in the scientific world is a good example: the mother class is animals, and within that main class there are mammals, reptiles, amphibians, insects, etc. Each of them is an animal, but with its own traits, such as warm or cold blooded, the way they breathe, such as fish vs bird vs insects, they each have different mechanisms for breathing but still ingest air. 


2. What is the benefit of making an empty abstract method in a base class?

*** Having an empty abstract method will force each instance of a child class to make its own variation of a method, so that they can all be distinct from the base class.


3. What is the most interesting thing you learned as a part of your work for this class this week?

*** I liked the recursion! It works so fast and easy, the hard part is figuring out the base case. At times I don't understand how it works, especially in the case of the Fibonacci solution, but it does work and with very little code!


4. Describe one specific way that you helped someone else this week, or reached out for help.

*** I reached out on slack for assistance, and got plenty of it!


5. Are there any topics from this week that you still feel uneasy about, or would like to learn more about? 

*** I think I am catching on to the solution to the issues I had recently. I believe I was confusing the parameters with the attributes in a class. 


6. How much time did you spend this week on each of the following:

Reading - 2.5 hours
Checkpoint A - 5 hours
Checkpoint B - 8 hours
Team Activity - 1.5 hours
Data Structures Homework - 4 hours
Prove Assignment - 3 hours

If you have other questions or comments for the instructor, please post them to Slack, either in the general channel if others can benefit, or as a direct message if the matter is more personal.
