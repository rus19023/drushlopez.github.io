Your Name: Doris Rush-Lopez

1. Why is it important to avoid updating the position of the object in the on_draw function?
--If that were done, it would never finish drawing, it would scramble what is being drawn because both draw and update are done potentially many times per second.

2. Besides game programming, can you think of any other applications that would likely use event-driven programming?
--Any kind of GUI app would need event driven programming to respond to what the user does with the keyboard, mouse or touch-screen/pad. 


3. What is the most interesting thing you learned as a part of your work for this class this week?
--Making bouncing balls! 


4. Describe one specific way that you helped someone else this week, or reached out for help.
--I used slack to both ask and answer questions.


5. Are there any topics from this week that you still feel uneasy about, or would like to learn more about?
--I guess I will eventually get more confident with which commands are used in which situation in classes. It just seems like a lot to take in so fast, especially with 3 other rather challenging courses. There have been many moments when I think I may have bit off more than I can chew.


6. How much time did you spend this week on each of the following:
